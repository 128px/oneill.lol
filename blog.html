		<h1>Content Creation!</h1>
		<p>I started making YouTube videos when I was around 10 years old, showcasing my love for Nerf blasters and attempting to prove I had some football skills (spoiler alert: I didn't). Eventually, that fizzled out, but the itch to create never left me.</p>
  
		<p>I moved to rural North Carolina from Everett, WA in 2021, and said goodbye to a lot of friends. Moving to NC was stressful and being confined to the house with nothing to do I decided to make TikTok videos of my Call of Duty gameplay. Surprisingly, my Call of Duty videos took off, and before I knew it, I had 30,000 followers and almost 1 million likes. It felt great to get recognition for something I was good at, especially in a game I loved. But here's the thing - the pressure to make every video perfect was draining. I'd spend hours practicing (<em>Here’s a crazy statistic, I spent about 1500 hours on Kovaak’s and Aim Lab to train my aim, which is about 1% of how long I have been alive.</em>), playing, and then end up with nothing I thought was good enough to post. I was drained and often didn’t post for months, and when I did post I often wasn’t validated by the thousands of likes I was hoping for. I tried going to YouTube, posting about new mice and mousepads I got sharing my thoughts on them, and reviewing some items some companies sent out to me (which was awesome!), but I just wasn’t fulfilled.</p>
  
		<p>Around the time I stopped posting regularly, I shifted gears. I started diving into more scholarly stuff - reading books (check out the “Books!” section above), brushing up on math (I'm going to be a physics major after all), and dialing back on gaming. It felt good to broaden my horizons.</p>
  
		<p>But lately, I've been feeling that itch again. So, I am starting a new YouTube channel where I'll be talking about science, philosophy, and sharing my thoughts on books I love. It's a way for me to learn more deeply and share what I'm really passionate about. I'm calling it <strong>Epiphica</strong> after the word epiphany, which may be pretentious and pseudo-profound but I like the sound of it so take that.</p>
  
		<p>For me content creation has been a rollercoaster. There have been highs, lows, and plenty of moments where I've questioned why I'm doing it. But ultimately, it's a part of who I am. And with Epiphica, I'm hoping to carve out a space where I can be myself and explore ideas that matter to me.</p>
